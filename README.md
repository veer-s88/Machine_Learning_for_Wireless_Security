# Machine_Learning_for_Wireless_Security
This repository contains the files of the code written for the individual research project

The files for the code written for this project can be found on the online GitHub repository: https://github.com/veer-s88/Machine_Learning_for_Wireless_Security. The file descriptions are shown below:
•	DCF_Simulator.py – This file provides the full code for the Python designed 802.11 WLAN simulator as described in Chapter 4.4.
•	DCF_Simulator_rogue_node.py – This file provides the full code for the Python designed 802.11 WLAN simulator with implementation of the selfish misbehaving nodes as described in Chapter 4.5
•	Basic Results Vis.ipynb – This file is the Jupyter Notebook which provides the Python code and visualisations of the fair 802.11 WLAN simulator QoS results as shown in Chapter 5.2. This file also shows the Python simulator validation results.
•	Results visualisation.ipynb – This file is the Jupyter Notebook which provides the Python code and visualisations of the selfish node misbehaviour simulation results as shown in Chapter 5.3
•	ML models to classify hostile action 2.ipynb – This file is the Jupyter Notebook which provides the Python code for data pre-processing and training, testing and evaluation of the ML models as described in Chapter 4.6 and 4.7. This file also shows the evaluation results visualisations for each ML model as shown in Chapter 5.3
•	Neural Network Model.ipynb – This file is the Jupyter Notebook which provides the code for building, training and testing the artificial neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras as well as the visualisations from evaluation of this model
